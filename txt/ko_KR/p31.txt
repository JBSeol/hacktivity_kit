Step 5

HACKTIVITY KIT

Work in Teams and Share

Let teens work together in teams and throughout the jam encourage them to take on specific roles on their project., such as visual designer, coder, project manager, documentarian, etc.

Have them present what they did, encouraging conversation about process and techniques. In just one sentence, everyone shares something useful that they learned. If someone says some thing interesting, shout it out and let them know that you agree. Embed a lightweight de-brief into the sharing of useful things. Take lots of photos throughout the jam and as soon as itâ€™s over, upload them to a public repository like Flickr.

TIP: When working with minors (under the age of 18) have parents sign permission slips.
