Step 3

HACKTIVITY KIT

Design the Lesson Plan

Break the learning goals down into small tasks that can be incorporated into your hack jam. With your team of volunteers and/or co-facilitators think about ways to embed assessment directly into the activity so that it is both a fun design activity and a meaningful learning experience.

Start out by designing ice-breakers and opportunities to get people to contribute to the design challenge and work collectively to make something by the end of the day.

Many events allow for some dedicated instruction combined with experimentation time. We have included a sample lesson plan for you to use as is, or as a template for your eventâ€™s theme of the day.
