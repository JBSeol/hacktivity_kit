STEP 1
HTML AND CSS BASICS

What is CSS?

HTML gives a page structure and meaning, but it’s still quite abstract because it’s meant to be consumed by all kinds of people using all kinds of media. When you want to give a page style that’s specific to a particular medium, you use a different language called CSS.

One easy way to tinker with CSS is by adding a style attribute to elements in your HTML. The contents of this attribute are CSS properties that tell a computer how to style the element. For example, we can use the color CSS property to set text color:

I can <em style=“color: red”>hear</em> you!

This will cause the word “hear” to be red. We can add more properties by separating them with semicolons, like so:

I can <em style=“color: red; background: pink”>hear</em> you!

This will cause the word “hear” to be red and have a pink background.

Playing with CSS properties can be lots of fun.

But what about when you want to make all <em> elements be styled this way? It sure is tedious to add the same style attribute to every occurrence, and this approach also makes it hard to change all the styles at once when you want to tinker. This is where CSS stylesheets come in, and they’re actually what most webpages use — but they’re also out of the scope of this tiny guide.
