HTML AND CSS BASICS

This takes an image of a cat from seriouscat.com and puts it in the webpage after the words “This is serious!”

Finally, it’s also possible to put elements inside each other, also known as nesting them:

<a href=“http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lolcat”>
	<img src=”http://seriouscat.com/serious_cat_is_serious.jpg”>
</a>

This hyperlinks the picture of a cat to the Wikipedia entry on Lolcat.
