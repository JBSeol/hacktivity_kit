STEP 1
TALKING POINTS

As you organize your jam, you will find people are curious about what you’re planning. They may be parents wondering whether to sign up their kids, potential volunteers trying to decide if they should enlist help or a school Principal who wants to get involved. Being prepared will help you get your key messages across.

• Local events or “hack jams” make webmaking and digital literacy easy, social and fun

• Hack jams are based on the premise that the web is a collaborative co-building environment

• We’ll be using Hackasaurus tools which help make it easy for youth to explore, remix and redesign the web

• Understanding how to tinker with code is a skill that’s in demand and makes youth more employable

• We’re designing around the way kids learn technology, based on cultural anthropologist Mizuko Ito’s concepts of hanging out, messing around and geeking out

• Taking part in a hack jam helps teens to develop learning competencies, including critical thinking and interpersonal skills

• Working as part of a group or managing a project are important soft skills that employers look for

• All of the tools and curricular content are designed to be peer learning experiences that are constructed and evolved by community input and contribution
