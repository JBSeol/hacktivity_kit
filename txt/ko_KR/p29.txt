Step 4

HACKTIVITY KIT

Define the space where you will be hosting the hack jam. Make sure that you have prepared both your technical materials as well as the physical space well in advance.

Think of all participants as makers, including facilitators, learners and volunteers. Make every attempt humanly possible to define the jam space as interactive. Move chairs into a circle. Set up design centers or stations so people can easily move about within the space. Break up the space as much as possible.

TIP: Set up a projector connected to a laptop for easy sharing of hacks.
