HTML AND CSS BASICS

What is HTML?

HTML is a special language used to tell computers how to build webpages so that humans can consume them. Here’s a really simple web page:

I can <em>hear</em> you!

People with vision will see this page as a single line of text with the word hear italicized. That’s because the word is wrapped in what we call tags that tell the computer to emphasize anything between them. If a blind person were listening to the webpage, a computerized voice might place emphasis on the word hear instead.

The combination of an opening tag — in this case, <em> —its corresponding closing tag — </em>—and the content in between is called an element. It’s a fundamental building block of a webpage.

There are many kinds of elements. Aside from the <em> element, one of the most useful elements is <a>, which can be used like this:

<a href=“http://wikipedia.org”>Wikipedia</a> is cool.

This element is slightly more complex because it includes an attribute, or piece of information that adds meaning to the element’s content. In this case, the href attribute tells a computer that “Wikipedia” is associated with — or hyperlinked to—the website wikipedia.org. That means clicking (or tapping) on the word will take the reader to Wikipedia’s website.

Some elements don’t actually contain any content, and hence have no closing tag, but represent special kinds of content themselves.
One example is the <img> tag:
￼
This is serious!
