5. Introduction to badges

Explain to participants that they will be able to collect paper badges for their accomplishments throughout the hack jam. At the end of a module, participants will “pledge” or apply for badges to gain specific super powers. They must successfully complete the pledged task in front of a peer mentor or facilitator who will award them the badge to show they’ve earned their superpower.
